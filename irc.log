<@cpup> for a really object-oriented language to work it needs to auto save
<@cpup> because recreating it every time is very difficult
<@cpup> hmm
<@cpup> not auto save but like smalltalk, saving an image and restoring it
<@cpup> which isn't actually that difficult for most things
<@cpup> some of those being running code and handles
<@cpup> rawr
<@cpup> types
<@cpup> http://gbracha.blogspot.com/2011/06/types-are-anti-modular.html
<@cpup> it's annoying
<@cpup> hmm
<@cpup> to pull methods out of classes just create a class that extends Function
<@cpup> hmm
<@cpup> i think i know how to make Poland work
<@cpup> Poland being my programming language
<@cpup> but of course to test it i need to rewrite it in another language
<@cpup> probably Scala
<@cpup> okay
<@cpup> it's parsing correctly 
<@cpup> how can NewSpeak modules be encapsulated at all
<@cpup> they need to declare all their dependencies
<@cpup> which is fine for his examples
<@cpup> but only works if all the utilities you need are in the language
<@cpup> hmm
<@cpup> but it can't really work any other way
<@cpup> because all the base types are parameters
<@cpup> but there is an api for all of them
<@cpup> otherwise they'd be unusable
<@cpup> smalltalk like syntax is powerful
<@cpup> but i can match it with poland
<@cpup> which really needs a better name
<@cpup> Doggish?
<@cpup> also Finch is cool
<@cpup> http://finch.stuffwithstuff.com/
<@cpup> nested block comments is a good idea
<@cpup> how could cascading be implemented in Poland?
<@cpup> Poland can't quite match other languages for arrays
@cpup> hmm

<@cpup> hmm
<@cpup> the vm shouldn't depend on a certain name
<@cpup> how can it not?
<@cpup> meta to_s
<@cpup> maybe?
<@cpup> it's probably ok for only one language to be allowed
<@cpup> at a time
<@cpup> well english and some other language
<@cpup> do functions need to be native?
<@cpup> probably
* cpup mumbles compiling... lambda calculus
* cpup mumbles "compiling... lambda calculus"
<@cpup> InstructionApplication?
<@cpup> no
<@cpup> (PRuntime, PObject, PObject) => PObject
<@cpup> yeah
<@cpup> there was a reason i wanted a name for it
